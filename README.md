# ScoreVista

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the 1st Innings score of T20 Cricket World Cup matches. The prediction model considers various features such as batting team, bowling team, city, runs scored, overs played, wickets fallen, and runs scored in the last 5 overs.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training.
- `app/`: Streamlit web application for score prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.

## Data

The `data/` directory contains raw and processed datasets used for model training and testing.

## Data Preprocessing & Model Training

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Streamlit App

The `app/` directory contains the Streamlit web application code (app.py) for integrating the machine learning model with a user-friendly interface.
